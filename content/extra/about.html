		<p>Oh boy where do I even begin. 
		I'm a software engineer working at literally the best 
		startup in the world, <a href="http://www.trackmaven.com" target="_blank">TrackMaven</a>.</p>
			

		<p>I consider myself a Polyglot developer although as of late I have been working exclusively in
		the Python realm. What can I say? It is a great language and so far I haven't found any compelling
		reasons to switch to anything else. I am working on various side project which I will post links to here shortly.</p>

		<p> My goal is to blog once a week, no matter how small the post. I want to get ideas and lessons out there for
		others to use. I come across a lot of ridiculousness in my day to day, and I think a lot of developers out there
		would benefit from seeing the solutions to the many obstacles I overcome.
